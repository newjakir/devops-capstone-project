This project has two codebases â€” one for the frontend and another for the backend.

- **Frontend**: A Vue.js Single Page Application (SPA) hosted in its own GitHub repository: [capstoneproject_frontend](https://github.com/newjakir/capstoneproject_frontend).  
- **Backend**: A Django-based REST API project, also hosted in a separate GitHub repository: [capstoneproject_backend](https://github.com/newjakir/capstoneproject_backend).

Each repository includes:  
- CI/CD pipeline definitions (GitHub Actions)  
- Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations
